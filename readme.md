# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 🌟 Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies to a user based on a selected title. The recommendations are generated by analyzing movie metadata, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

The core of the system relies on pre-computed similarity scores (likely Cosine Similarity) to ensure fast and efficient lookups.

## ✨ Features
* **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the characteristics of a chosen movie.
* **Fast Lookups:** Uses pre-calculated similarity data (`similarity.pkl`) for near-instantaneous results.
* **Data Processing:** Utilizes key metadata from the TMDB datasets for feature engineering.

## 💾 Data Source
The system is built using the following datasets from The Movie Database (TMDB), which are included in this repository:
* `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: The primary dataset containing movie metadata such as title, genres, keywords, and overview.
* `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains the cast and crew information for the movies, used for feature extraction.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Package manager `pip`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or ensure all files are in the same directory):
    ```bash
    git clone <Your_Repository_URL>
    cd movie_recommendation
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    The core analysis and serving typically require the following packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
    # Add 'streamlit' or 'flask' if a web interface is used
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    *(Note: Replace `app.py` or the notebook name with your actual main file.)*
    * If you have a main Python script (e.g., a Streamlit or Flask app):
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
    * If you are running the project through a Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        # Then open your main analysis notebook (e.g., Movie_Recommendation.ipynb)
        ```
